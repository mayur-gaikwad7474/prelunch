                <h2>4. General Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    Premium features of the Service will require you to pay fees upon registering for the
                    applicable premium service. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review
                    and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars & Indian Rupees
                    and are non-refundable. Fees vary based on the plan, with different pricing schemes for
                    individual users and organizations.
                </p>
                <h4>4.1 Price</h4>
                <p>
                    Creatosaurus reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Creatosaurus will make
                    reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage
                    you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Creatosaurus may change
                    the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Creatosaurus
                    gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Creatosaurus, at its sole discretion,
                    may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Creatosaurus’s
                    customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your
                    offer or these Terms.
                </p>
                <h4>4.2 Authorization</h4>
                <p>
                    You authorize Creatosaurus to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of
                    Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Creatosaurus, to the payment
                    method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Creatosaurus may
                    seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the
                    credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.
                </p>
                <h4>4.3 Subscription Service and Cancellation Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription
                    Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Creatosaurus to periodically
                    charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your
                    account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The
                    “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the
                    Service. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our Pricing page. Your account
                    will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next
                    subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription
                    or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid
                    billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic
                    Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a
                    different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the
                    Subscription Service by accessing your account settings and clicking on the "Cancel Plan"
                    option or by contacting us at: contact@creatosaurus.io.

                    Creatosaurus may suspend or terminate access to the Service for any account for which any amount
                    is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be
                    charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid
                    amount, including collection fees.

                    other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited. “Streaming” means a
                    contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the
                    Creatosaurus Service to a User’s device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time

                    or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for
                    any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement,
                    or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this
                    Agreement. If your account is terminated for any reason, you must obtain written authorization
                    from Creatosaurus prior to establishing another account. If you attempt to establish another
                    account without obtaining such authorization, Creatosaurus may permanently ban you from the
                    Service. You may not have more than one active account at any time without the written consent
                    of Creatosaurus in each instance.

                    ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY

                </p>
                <p>
                    EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 16.4(iii) AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
                    THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE CREATOSAURUS ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

                    MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.

                <h2>16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
                <p>
                    In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Creatosaurus in the most expedient and cost
                    effective manner, and except as described in Section 16.2, you and Creatosaurus agree that every
                    dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration
                    is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or
                    jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review
                    by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
                    This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect
                    of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other
                    legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these
                    Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CREATOSAURUS ARE
                    EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
                </p>
                <h2>17. General Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by
                    reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you
                    and Creatosaurus regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms
                    or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without
                    our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent.
                    The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require
                    performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of
                    these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default
                    or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience
                    only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms
                    the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms
                    is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the
                    greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
